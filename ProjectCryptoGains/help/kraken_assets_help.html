			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<p><i>- Upon saving, if you see a message showing there were malconfigured asset(s) detected, check the log in the main window for more details on the malconfigured asset(s)
				  - Doublecheck that LABEL matches their corresponding LABEL in the Asset Catalog, which can be reached via Configure => Asset Catalog
                  - If there is no typo and there is no matching LABEL in the Asset Catalog, you need to add the ASSET/LABEL in the Asset Catalog</i></p>
