            <h2>What are Exchange Rates?</h2>
			<p>Exchange rates in PCG are stored per DATE, ASSET, FIAT_CURRENCY combination;
			   Every time an exchange rate is needed and it is not yet stored by PCG, PCG will retrieve the exchange rate 
			   via the CoinDesk Data API and store it for later use
			
               <i>Exchange rates from the CoinDesk Data API are retrieved using the opening price on the relevant date;
			   This approach limits API calls and maintains performance, with the assumption that consistently using 
			   opening prices provides a balanced representation of historical price data</i></p>
        </section>
