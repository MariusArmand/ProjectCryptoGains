	    <section>
			<h3>Why are my airdrops in from my Kraken ledgers csv not picked processed</h3>
			<p>In the Kraken ledgers CSV, airdrops are identified by the type 'transfer' and subtype 'spotfromfutures',
			   but these attributes may not unique to airdrops; Hence, PCG does not process ledger entries with the type 'transfer'
			   For airdrops, a manual ledger entry should be made and uploaded via Sources => Manual Ledgers<p>

    <main>

			<h3>Retrieved 0.00 exchange rate</h3>
			<p>In rare cases, the CoinDesk Data API might return 0.00 as the exchange rate; In this case, PCG will show a warning 
			   and log the problematic record in the main window; This will obviously impact calculation accuracy<p>
